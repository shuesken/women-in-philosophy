To examine temporal trends in visibility at the highest levels of prestige, they examined authorship rates over time in five elite journals. Three of the journals were Philosophical Review, Mind, andJournal of Philosophy, sometimes referred to as the “big three” general philosophy journals. All three have been regarded as leading journals since at least the early 20th century, and they tend to top informal polls of journal prestige, such as polls on the Leiter Reports blog, sometimes alongside relative newcomer Noûs (e.g. Leiter 2013, 2015). Since these journals publish proportionately less in ethics than in other areas of philosophy, they also included two elite ethics journals, Ethics andPhilosophy & Public Affairs, which tend to top polls of ethics journals (e.g. Bradley 2005, Leiter 2009), although Philosophy & Public Affairshas only been publishing since 1972."))}},nrrM:function(l,e,n){}}]);
