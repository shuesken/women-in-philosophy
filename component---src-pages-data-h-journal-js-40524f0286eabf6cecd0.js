Since these journals publish proportionately less in ethics than in other areas of philosophy, they also included two elite ethics journals, Ethics andPhilosophy & Public Affairs, which tend to top polls of ethics journals (e.g. Bradley 2005, Leiter 2009), although Philosophy & Public Affairshas only been publishing since 1972."))}}}]);
